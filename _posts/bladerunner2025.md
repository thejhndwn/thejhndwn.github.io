Writing papers in school, my teachers would say "Don't cite Wikipedia, it's not reliable!". Maybe if they had studied up a little more on their Open Source Philosophy they'd understand the power of community moderation.

And in 2025, Wiki[^1] with its biases stands as one of the most used, visited, and trusted sources online.
To my mind there isn't a similarly almanaic definitive source on the web.
Coincidentally, it was its open editing, the source of suspicion, that made it so definitive and trustworthy. 

In the same way I expect AI-powered avatars to experience the same level of trust and aprehension at first. 



When I imagine a cyberpunk/bladerunner dystopia its grimy, its neon, fiat currency is online, and AI avatars are everywhere and the main news source and media. 


things to talk aobut
> we didn't trust wikipedia before, but now we do
> open source can remove bugs
> AI avatar media is the future
> trusting wikipedia > forums, is going to be the same as trusting ai avatars > people
> huamns are real, but dishonest. AI is fake, but adherent
> dead internet theory
> humans vs AI who will prevail

[^1]: "wiki" was originally a Hawaiian term meaning 'quick' which saw usage with the popularisation of WikiWikiWeb, the first user-editable website, in 1995. If you didn't know that, you're likely the victim of **[S-E-M-A-N-T-I-C DRIFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change)**
