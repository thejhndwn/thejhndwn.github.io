Title: My Seven Year Hiatus

```
In the Summer of 2016 I was exposed to marijuana for the first time. At the time of writing I can still remember that day clearly. There was no peer pressure - I was looking for something different and became enamored with weed after my first puff. Yes, this is another essay on drugs, but more philosophical in their intent and usage, rather than an examination on its scientific perspectives. I'm going to talk about it like a relationship because that's what it was to me for seven long, developmental years. 

Some background I grew up in a Christian and Asian household. My mom isn't a fanatic disciple but she is devout and she lead the household. I can not stress enough she sacrificed tirelessly for her family
