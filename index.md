# About Site #
Here you can find essays about philosophy and my travels. Life is YOUR greatest mystery and is meant to be enjoyed, explored, and implored. It's a shame to treat it with the respect it deserves.

# About Me #
I'm not really a tech guy, although I'm expecting people to come here primarily for that as this is hosted on Github, but I just didn't grow up with computers so it was never a particular interest of mine. I did grow up watching TV shows, reading books, and hanging out with friends. Very uneventful, normal childhood. But I have always enjoyed doing things well and in a good-looking way, and that to me is doing things right. And I've always been inventive, resourceful and enjoyed weird riddles and problems (particularly involving logic or out-of-box thinking). I don't really have a knack or fondness for anything, I'm more of a Master of None and a specialist as the need arises*. I don't play many mainstream games but I am particularly drawn to grindy dungeony games, games of economy and strategy games. Games I like(d) are Pokemon, Persona, Coup, Mafia, Chess, Pixel Dungeon, Legend of Zelda, Dragonville, and Tycoon games. One of my long term goals is to settle somewhere and start an affordable cafe on a farm with a SOTA kitchen for culinary exploration. But before then I'll be trying my best to explore the world and its people. Thanks for reading!



*I do happen to be one of the best in the world at this Chinese math/card game called [24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(puzzle)) which you can [play here](https://www.4nums.com/).
