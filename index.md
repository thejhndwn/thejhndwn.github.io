Here you can find essays about philosophy and my travels. Life is YOUR greatest mystery and is meant to be enjoyed, explored, and implored. It is a shame to not give it the respect it deserves.

# About Me #
I'm not really a tech guy, although I'm expecting people to come here primarily for that as this is hosted on Github, but I just didn't grow up with computers so it was never a particular interest of mine. I did grow up watching shows, reading books, and hanging out with friends. Very uneventful, normal childhood. But I have always enjoyed doing things well and in a good-looking way, and that to me is doing things right. And I've always been inventive, resourceful and enjoyed weird riddles and problems (particularly involving logic or out-of-box thinking). And I've always been obsessed with starting a business and generating a cycle of revenue. I'm not sure why but business is just something I love (my father was an entreprenuer). I don't really have a knack or fondness for anything, I'm more of a Master of None and a specialist as the need arises*. I don't play many mainstream games but I am particularly drawn to grindy dungeony games, games of economy and strategy games. Games I like(d) are Pokemon, Persona, Coup, Mafia, Chess, Pixel Dungeon, Legend of Zelda, Dragonville, and Tycoon games. I'm also very obtuse towards things I don't think are important like politics, tech, and celebrities. Or for example not burning bridges. I prefer some bridges be burned so I'm not drawn to crossing them again. My long term goals are to settle somewhere and start an affordable cafe on a farm with a SOTA kitchen for culinary exploration. I think something like that would be cool and inviting trained chefs on scholarship to come and contribute would be fun.  



*I do happen to be one of the best in the world at this Chinese math/card game called [24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(puzzle)) which you can [play here](https://www.4nums.com/).
